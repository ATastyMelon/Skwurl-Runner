# Skwurl Runner

Skwurl Runner is a Gorilla Tag like game I am trying to make for fun and a learning experience

Skwurl Runner will be coming to applab in the future, and maybe a pcvr port also?

## Requirements

Oculus Quest 1 or 2

Sidequestvr and a link cable

## Installation

Open sidequest and have your quest connect to your pc, and drag the skwurlrunner.apk file onto sidequest to install.

## Have Fun!
